# Tewo Republic
At Tewo Republic, we’re making buying and selling food easier and fairer for everyone involved. We’ve created an online platform where farmers and sellers can connect directly with buyers, using blockchain technology to keep things transparent and secure. By cutting out the middlemen, we help keep prices fair and put more money in the hands of those who grow and sell our food. We’re here to support our agricultural communities and bring fresh, affordable food to everyone.## Available Scripts
